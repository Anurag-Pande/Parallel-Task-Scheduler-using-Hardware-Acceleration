# Parallel-Task-Scheduler-using-Hardware-Acceleration
We designed a Parallel Task Scheduler which runs on NVIDIA's CUDA GPU which we used for getting faster execution speed of tasks such as Matrix Multiplications and Parallel Word Count, we also compared these results with sequential programs to measure the difference between the execution speeds of the same
